### Known Limitations:

  * Interpreter has fixed ammount of memory to use for .bf prograns. 
  *Although it can be changed in compile time.*
  * Interpreter has a fixed limit for nested loops. 
  *It can also be changed in compile time.*
  * This is 8 bit cell implementation. 
  *Bf prograns which need 16 (or more) bits cells are unsuported.*
